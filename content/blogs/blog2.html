<p>Did you know? Byblos, the Lebanese city shown above is one of the oldest continuously inhabited towns in the world. The name Byblos is Greek; papyrus received its early Greek name (byblos, byblinos) from its being exported to the Aegean through Byblos. Hence the English word Bible is derived from Byblos as “the (papyrus) book.”</p>
