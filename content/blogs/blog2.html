<p>Did you know? Byblos, the Lebanese city shown above is one of the oldest continuously inhabited towns in the world. The name Byblos is Greek; papyrus received its early Greek name (byblos, byblinos) from its being exported to the Aegean through Byblos. Hence the English word Bible is derived from Byblos as “the (papyrus) book.”</p>

<p>On the 17th of October 2019, a series of demonstrations started taking place in Lebanon, which were triggered by planned taxes on gasoline and Whatsapp, and quickly expanded into a country-wide condemnation of the ruling class, sectarian system, flawed financial practices, and unemployment. Since then, the Lebanese currency lost up to 90% of its value.</p>

<p>Moreover, on 4 August 2020, a large amount of ammonium nitrate stored at Lebanon’s main port of Beirut exploded, causing more than 218 deaths, 7,000 injuries, and US$15 billion in property damage, and leaving around 300,000 people homeless. An investigation is still ongoing until this day, and many conspiracies theories have been made around the causes and those to blame. Many people have accused the country’s leaders of culpability through their alleged negligence and corruption.
By the way, i personnaly left the site of the explosion fifteen minutes before it happened, and many of my friends lost their homes and loved ones.</p>

<p>However, Lebanon remains a great country. You can have the best nightlife in Beirut’s pubs and clubs, ski and swim in the same day, go from north to south in only three hours, and enjoy the Lebanese multiculturalism, people, and most importantly food (no matter how cliche this sounds). Lebanese people are known for their generosity, diversity, and success abroad. Indeed, you meet Lebanese people everywhere you go in the world. Did you know that there are 15 million people of Lebanese origin living outside Lebanon while only 4 million Lebanese live in Lebanon?!</p>
