<p>Did you know? Byblos, the Lebanese city shown above is one of the oldest continuously inhabited towns in the world. The name Byblos is Greek; papyrus received its early Greek name (byblos, byblinos) from its being exported to the Aegean through Byblos. Hence the English word Bible is derived from Byblos as “the (papyrus) book.”</p>

<p>On the 17th of October 2019, a series of demonstrations started taking place in Lebanon, which were triggered by planned taxes on gasoline and Whatsapp, and quickly expanded into a country-wide condemnation of the ruling class, sectarian system, flawed financial practices, and unemployment. Since then, the Lebanese currency lost up to 90% of its value.</p>
