<p>Although he looks intimading, my dog is very sweet and kind. He barks a lot but when real danger arises, he’s the first to escape.</p>

<p>People think he’s a Pitbull. He’s not. He’s an American Staffordshire, the Pitbull’s cousin</p>
<p><img src="/img/Tyson%203.jpg" /><!-- --></p>
<p>He loves attention</p>
