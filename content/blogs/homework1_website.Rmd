# Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?

Back in 2014, [fivethiryeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/) published an article on alchohol consumption in different countries. The data `drinks` is available as part of the `fivethirtyeight` package. Make sure you have installed the `fivethirtyeight` package before proceeding.


```{r, load_alcohol_data}
library(fivethirtyeight)
data(drinks)


# or download directly
alcohol_direct <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/alcohol-consumption/drinks.csv")

```


What are the variable types? Any missing values we should worry about? 

```{r glimpse_skim_data}

#str(alcohol_direct)
skimr::skim(alcohol_direct)

```
**The output shows that there are not missing data but the zero values might indicate that consumption in the respective countries may be negligible**

Make a plot that shows the top 25 beer consuming countries

```{r beer_plot}
alcohol_direct %>% 
  slice_max(order_by = beer_servings, n=25) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = beer_servings, y = fct_reorder(country, beer_servings))) +
  geom_col(fill='yellow') +
  theme_bw()+
  labs(
    title = "Top 25 Beer Consuming Countries",
    subtitle = "African countries lead the table and Europena countries follow",
    x = "beer servings",
    y = NULL
  )

```

Make a plot that shows the top 25 wine consuming countries

```{r wine_plot}


alcohol_direct %>% 
  slice_max(order_by = wine_servings, n=25) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = wine_servings, y = fct_reorder(country, wine_servings))) +
  geom_col(fill='red') +
  theme_bw()+
  labs(
    title = "Top 25 Wine Consuming Countries",
    subtitle = "France leads the table with other European countries dominating",
    x = "wine servings",
    y = NULL
  )

```

Finally, make a plot that shows the top 25 spirit consuming countries
```{r spirit_plot}

alcohol_direct %>% 
  slice_max(order_by = spirit_servings, n=25) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = spirit_servings, y = fct_reorder(country, spirit_servings))) +
  geom_col(fill='grey90') +
  theme_bw()+
  labs(
    title = "Top 25 Spirit Consuming Countries",
    subtitle = "Grenada leads the list ",
    x = "spirit servings",
    y = NULL
  )
```

What can you infer from these plots? Don't just explain what's in the graph, but speculate or tell a short story (1-2 paragraphs max).

**The first graph shows us that two African countries are among the top 3 beer consumers. In fact, Namibia, which ranks first on the list is known for its home made beer (ex: Windhoek). Also, Gabon has the cheapest priced alcoholic beverages in Africa and second in the world, which might be an explanation to its high ranking. Generally, Europe still dominates the list, which is expected.**\

**The second graph shows that France leads the list of top wine consumers, with other European countries dominating the ranking as well. Knowing that the numbers are on a per capita basis, we wonder if other highly populated countries (ex: US, China...) would appear in a ranking of absolute consumption.**

**The third paragraph shows that Eastern European countries dominate leadership perhaps due to Vodka consumption and the cold climate in general.**

**Overall, the results are within expectation and group members' understandings of alcohol consumption across the globe.**
