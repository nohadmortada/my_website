Thank you again for visiting my page. Following is a short story of my life (not so short):
I have lived in five countries throughout my childhood, acquiring a sense of openness, learning three languages, and picking a fourth more recently. This has built me an eagerness to constantly want to meet new people coming from different backgrounds and having different walks of lives. No wonder why i ended up at LBS! Indeed, after two months at the business school, i realised how multicultural it is and how much it cherishes diversity.
I aspire to become an Investment Banker, and i believe the MFA to be the perfect stepping stone towards such a difficult yet thrilling career. Throughout my undergraduate years at UCL, i seized every single opportunity to build my finance knowledge, by for instance undertaking an internship in Private Equity, and reading "Investment Banking" by Joshua Pearl.
In my free time, i enjoy weightlifting, playing and watching football (not anymore since Messi left Barcelona for PSG), and travelling. I also recently developed a new interest: data analytics. Indeed, the Data Analytics For Finance at LBSis one that i enjoyed very much.
Please don't hesitate to contact me or reach out to me through any of my social media platforms for which i provided the link below.
