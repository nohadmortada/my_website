Although he looks intimading, my dog is very sweet and kind. He barks a lot but when real danger arises, he's the first to escape.

```{r, echo= FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/Tyson 2.jpg",error =FALSE)
```

People think he's a Pitbull. He's not. He's an American Staffordshire, the Pitbull's cousin

```{r, echo= FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/Tyson 3.jpg",error =FALSE)
```

He loves attention

```{r, echo= FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/Tyson 4.jpg",error =FALSE)
```

And sun!
